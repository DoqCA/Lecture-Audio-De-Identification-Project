# Lecture-Audio-De-Identification-Project

*Note, this is an older older project and much of the code has been lost as it was developed on an older Macbook. It is being reconstructed from my documentation for GitHub showcase purposes!*

## Basic Project Overview:
C++ (Production) and Python (Prototyping and Model development) Real Time Audio editing application for a professor. Application captured and edited lecture audio in real time to comply with FOIP regulations (specifically removal of student audio and student names).  A supervised learning model was trained to differentiate professor, student and shared audio signatures in lecture audio, along with pre-processing to determine distance from mic using Root Mean Square (RMS) Amplitude. Automatic Speec Recognition was used subsequently on the student-audio-removed lecture audio to flag potential names for removal based on a student list, which the professor manually reviewed.
